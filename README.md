# Approach to Generating Insights About Career Paths for IIT Graduates
Once you have collected data on IIT graduates from LinkedIn (such as names, job titles, and companies/industries), you can use it to generate insights about their career paths. The analysis could be used to identify common trends, career progression patterns, or areas where IIT graduates are excelling. Here's an approach to analyze the data:

## Step 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Remove invalid or missing data
Standardize job titles and industries
## Step 2: Categorization
Job Title Categorization: Group similar job titles into broader categories such as:
Software Engineering (e.g., Software Engineer, Backend Developer, Full Stack Developer)
Data Science (e.g., Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Machine Learning Engineer)
## Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Job Title Analysis: Identify the most common job titles pursued by IIT graduates and examine their distribution.
Industry Analysis
Career Progression
## Step 4: Insights Generation
Top Job Categories
Industry Trends
Geographical Distribution
## Step 5: Visualization
Bar Charts and Pie Charts.
Trend Analysis
## Notes
- LinkedIn Terms of Service: Please be aware that LinkedIn has strict rules against scraping, and this script should be used with caution. Always review LinkedIn's terms of service to ensure compliance.
